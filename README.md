# PhD Student in Electrical Engineering with a Focus on Ethical AI
I am Maiane Junqueira Teixeira Neto, a PhD student in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Ethical AI and Computer Engineering at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp). I hold a Master’s degree from Unicamp, in which I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies. Additionally, I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and gained international academic experience as an Exchange Student at Fontbonne University in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently, my research interests lie in Ethical Artificial Intelligence. I believe that Artificial Intelligence is an advancing technology that must be developed and implemented carefully to avoid harmful behavior towards vulnerable groups.
